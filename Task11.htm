        <p>The equation for calculating the area of a square is <strong>A = s<sup>2</sup></strong>, where <b>A</b> is the area and <b>s</b> is the side length.</p>
        <p>The Pythagorean theorem is <strong>a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup></strong>, where <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> are the legs of the triangle and <b>c</b> is the hypotenuse.</p>
        <p>The formula for compound interest is <strong>A = P(1 + r/n)<sup>nt</sup></strong>, where <b>A</b> is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.</p>
